# A generic interpreter for Basilisk C

This directory contains the source code and test cases for a generic
interpreter for Basilisk C.

The main files are:

* [interpreter.c](): the source code for the interpreter.
* [declarations.h](): Declarations of Basilisk-specific default
  variables and constants.
* [overload.h](): replacement functions for some system- or
  Basilisk-specific functions and macros.
* [internal.h](): prototypes for functions which are
  internally-defined in the interpreter.
* `test*.c` and `test*.ref`: the source code and reference files for the
  test suite. These should be run using the [Makefile]() and:
  
    ~~~bash
    make check
    ~~~

The interpreter is used in particular for [dimensional analysis](dimension.c).
