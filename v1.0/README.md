# Drop-impact-on-viscous-liquid-films

## Note

This folder contains the v1.0 of this codebase. This code was used for the paper: "Drop impact on viscous liquid films" by Sanjay et al. (2022). However, this code will probably not work with the latest Basilisk version due to several changes that make the code back-incompatible. To look at the lastest version of this codebase that works with latest version of Basilisk, see [README](../README.md). One of the broken changes is that adapt_wavelet_limited.h does not work by default. See: [https://github.com/comphy-lab/adapt-wavelet-limited](https://github.com/comphy-lab/adapt-wavelet-limited) for details.
